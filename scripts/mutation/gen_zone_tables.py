"""Generate the committed per-zone mutation tables from campaign results.

Outputs, in canonical zone order (scripts/f16_zones.tsv):

  docs/mutation/baseline.tsv   frozen floor per zone (the measurement at freeze time)
  docs/mutation/zones.tsv      current measurement table

Both share the same 7-column shape the gate parses:

  zone|msi|covered_msi|total|status|evidence|reason

Zones without a measurement yet are written as UNKNOWN with a reason, so the gate
still sees a complete zone set while a campaign is in flight. Re-run this script
after the campaign finishes to replace those rows with real numbers.

SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
----------------------
The numbers in a row are derived from the evidence file the row CITES, not from the
campaign aggregate (build/zone-campaign-results.json). Deriving them from the
aggregate while citing a different file is what allowed a row to report one run's
score next to another run's evidence — e.g. a zone whose cited summary said
`Killed 103 / Escaped 10` (MSI 88.03) sitting behind a row that said 87.18 because
the aggregate came from a later measurement.

The evidence file chosen for a zone is the STRICTER of the two candidates:

  * docs/mutation/evidence/infection-summary-<zone>.json  (already committed)
  * build/infection-summary-<zone>.json                   (this campaign)

A weaker measurement never overwrites a stronger committed one, so re-running this
script cannot lower a recorded floor — mutation scores wobble by a mutant between
runs, and silently freezing the lower number would weaken the ratchet (AR-2:
never weaken a gate so a cycle passes). When the committed evidence is the weaker
of the two, the row records that in the reason column instead of hiding it.
