# LOCAL-ONLY helper: run PHP-CS-Fixer over STAGED PHP files only.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Why this exists:
#   "php-cs-fixer check" with no arguments walks the whole Finder tree
#   (src + tests). Before a commit you only care about the files you actually
#   staged, so this helper narrows the scope to those files.
#
# Cache:
#   Uses the local cache (--using-cache=yes) and leaves the cache file at its
#   default location (.php-cs-fixer.cache, already git-ignored) so unchanged
#   files are not re-checked. The committed CI scripts deliberately do the
#   opposite (--using-cache=no) - CI must stay deterministic and full-tree.
#
# Scope:
#   --path-mode=intersection means "intersection of the Finder paths from the
#   repository config AND the paths given here", so the repository's own
#   configuration (.php-cs-fixer.dist.php, @PSR12) remains the authority and
#   this helper cannot widen the checked set to files outside src/ and tests/.
#
# PHP-CS-Fixer remains the AUTHORITY for formatting. This script never writes -
# it only reports, so "fix locally" stays an explicit, separate action.
#
# Exit codes follow PHP-CS-Fixer: 8 = files need fixing, 0 = compliant.
