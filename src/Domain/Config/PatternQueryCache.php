 */

namespace Zef\Framework\Config;

/**
 * Memoizes repeated {@see Config::query()} pattern results.
 *
 * `Config::query('database.connections.*.host')` fans out over the radix
 * index on every call; for hot paths that issue the SAME handful of patterns
 * per request (connection enumeration, feature-flag sweeps, per-driver
 * settings), this decorator answers every call after the first from an
 * in-process memo. Results are keyed by the exact pattern string, so the
 * cache's cardinality is bounded by the number of DISTINCT patterns an
 * application uses — never by data values.
 *
 * Invalidation is structural, not temporal: {@see Config} is immutable and
 * this cache is bound to ONE bag instance for its whole lifetime, so a
 * re-freeze/re-compile of the configuration (always a NEW Config instance)
 * simply gets a NEW cache — stale answers are impossible by construction.
 * {@see clear()} exists for long-lived workers that want the memo footprint
 * back between jobs.
 *
 * The issue #60 sketch wraps the radix tree directly; wrapping the public
 * {@see Config} surface instead keeps the tree `@internal` (it is private to
 * the bag) while providing the identical keyed memoization, and lets the
 * decorator benefit from the bag's sorted, deterministic result shape.
 * Copy-on-write makes returning the memoized array safe: callers who mutate
 * their result get a private copy, the cached series is untouched.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately ONLY the pattern query: `subtree()` and
 * `longestMatch()` take arbitrary concrete keys, and caching those would
 * grow with data (unbounded cardinality) for a microsecond hash-map walk.
