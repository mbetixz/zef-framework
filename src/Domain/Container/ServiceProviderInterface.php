 *     time get() asks for one of the IDs returned by provides().
 *   - provides(): the service IDs this provider is able to register. Used to
 *     decide when a deferred provider must be triggered.
 *
 * Implementations MUST only compose definitions (no resolution inside
 * register()); runtime wiring belongs in BootableProviderInterface::boot().
 * Since the issue #36 exit ramp the composition handle is the
 * ServiceRegistrarInterface port, so that convention is now enforced at
 * the type level: the container handle exposes register()/alias() only.
