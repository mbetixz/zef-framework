 *   and a {@see ConcurrencyException} is raised on a version mismatch;
 * - {@see loadStream()} returns the aggregate's events ordered by `version`
 *   ascending; an unknown stream is an empty list, not an error;
 * - {@see streamAll()} exposes the store-wide timeline ordered by
 *   `globalSequence` ascending for catch-up projections.
 *
 * Implementations SHOULD participate in an ambient transaction when one is
 * already open on the underlying connection (transaction level > 0) so the
 * {@see AggregateRepository} can commit events
 * and outbox entries atomically.
