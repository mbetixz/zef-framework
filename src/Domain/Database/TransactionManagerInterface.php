/**
 * Outbound port for framework-level transaction ORCHESTRATION.
 *
 * v2.18.0 gave {@see ConnectionInterface} the raw transaction primitives
 * (nested BEGIN/SAVEPOINT, commit, rollback, isolation). v2.22.0 adds the
 * orchestration layer on top of them, with the two capabilities the raw
 * primitives deliberately do not provide:
 *
 * 1. AFTER-COMMIT HOOKS — {@see afterCommit()} queues work that must run
 *    only after the OUTERMOST transaction commits (event fan-out, cache
 *    invalidation, notifications). Hooks are discarded when the scope
 *    rolls back, so a failed command never emits its events. Outside a
 *    managed scope, hooks execute immediately: callers do not need to
 *    know whether a transaction is already open.
 *
 * 2. A MANAGED SCOPE — {@see withTransaction()} composes the connection's
 *    primitive with hook scheduling, so nested managed scopes collapse
 *    into one atomic commit at the outermost level.
 *
 * Semantics that implementations MUST honour:
 *
 * - Hook ordering is FIFO per scope; hooks registered by nested scopes
 *   flush together after the outermost commit, and a hook registered
 *   DURING hook flushing executes immediately (the queue is already
 *   being drained, so re-queueing would be ambiguous);
 * - When a scope fails, hooks registered within it (including successful
 *   descendants) are discarded, while earlier hooks survive. Outermost
 *   failure discards every queued hook — never replayed on a retry;
 * - A hook that throws propagates AFTER the commit has been applied:
 *   the data is committed, the failure is real, the caller observes it
 *   (mirrors the CQRS event fan-out contract);
 * - Raw connection transactions (via {@see ConnectionInterface} directly)
 *   bypass hook scheduling by design: hooks follow MANAGED scopes only,
 *   so mixing the two layers stays predictable.
