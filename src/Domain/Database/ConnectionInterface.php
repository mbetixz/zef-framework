     * before relying on $isolation in nested calls):
     * - $isolation is honoured ONLY when this call opens the OUTERMOST
     *   transaction (transactionLevel() === 0 on entry);
     * - in a NESTED call the $isolation argument is SILENTLY DROPPED:
     *   the inner scope is a SAVEPOINT of the already-running outer
     *   transaction, which keeps the isolation level chosen at the

     *   transaction, so attempting it per-savepoint is impossible —
     *   the framework chooses the predictable "ignore" behaviour here
     *   (as opposed to beginTransaction(), which throws when nested).
     *   Do NOT pass $isolation from library code that may run nested —
     *   it will not do what the caller expects;
     * - the effective level therefore comes from the OUTERMOST
     *   transaction() / beginTransaction() call on the connection.
