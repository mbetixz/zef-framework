 * ZEF Framework — Domain layer (ports, contracts, value objects)
 *
 * Issue #55: instance-based read surface for the environment port.
 *
 * The interface carries ONLY the read API — typed accessors over process
 * environment state, no side effects, no cross-layer references — so it is
 * safe to place in the Domain layer next to the other ports
 * (SecurityPolicy and friends already read the process environment through
 * this surface).
 *
 * Method names carry the read- prefix because PHP forbids a class from
 * holding both a static method and an instance method with the same name:
 * Env keeps its historic static API (int/bool/string/csv, 38 call sites at
 * the time the issue was opened) AND implements this port with the
 * read-prefixed instance surface — one class, two calling conventions,
 * zero behavioural change to existing call sites.
 *
 * `Env` (same namespace) is the concrete implementing class; the kernel
 * composition root binds this port as an ordinary container service
 * (Adapters/Kernel/Application.php), next to
 * OtlpExporterFactoryInterface and ServiceRegistrarInterface. New
 * production code depends on the port, never on the concrete class.
