 *
 * - Upcasters are chained per event type in registration order, and an
 *   upcaster may rename the event into a type that owns its own upcasters —
 *   the walk continues, so a legacy payload traverses the full migration
 *   path (v1→v2→v3); a rename cycle is rejected after {@see MAX_HOPS};
 * - {@see transform()} is a pass-through for event types without any
 *   upcaster, so streams recorded in the current schema pay zero cost;
 * - identity guard: an upcaster may rename the event or reshape its
 *   payload/metadata, but the stream coordinates (event id, aggregate
 *   type/id, version, global sequence, recorded-at) are frozen — a
 *   violation throws {@see EventSourcingException} instead of silently
 *   corrupting the replay.
