/**
 * The v2.27.0 async rules kernel: evaluates every rule as its own coroutine
 * on the v2.26.0 FiberScheduler, with a concurrency cap, cooperative
 * per-rule deadlines and optional fail-fast — deterministic, single-threaded,
 * no preemption.
 *
 * Structure per evaluation (all handles stay engine-internal):
 * - one BODY task per rule ("rule-<name>"): acquires a semaphore permit,
 *   spawns the INNER task that actually invokes the rule, awaits it, then
 *   converts every possible outcome into exactly one verdict — the body is
 *   total and never fails.
 * - one INNER task per rule ("eval-<name>"): raw rule invocation under the
 *   evaluation's cancellation token.
 * - one GUARD timer per guarded rule ("eval-<name>-deadline"): cancels the
 *   inner task when the per-rule deadline wins, which surfaces at the body's
 *   await as TaskCancelledException.
 *
 * Cancellation mapping at the body (the only place verdicts are decided):
 * - TaskCancelledException with the evaluation cancelled -> Skipped
 *   (fail-fast won the race);
 * - TaskCancelledException without a cancellation request -> deadline miss
 *   (the guard is the only other canceller of an inner task), reported as a
 *   Failed timeout verdict;
 * - any other throwable -> Failed verdict carrying the original throwable;
 * - a returned verdict is taken as-is.
 *
 * Fail-fast cancels every still-pending sibling: bodies queued before their
 * first step or parked on the semaphore are cancelled directly, while an
 * in-flight rule is interrupted through its inner task — TaskCancelledException
 * hits the rule at its next suspension point, so a rule MAY catch it and
 * return its own verdict (graceful cancellation); one that lets it escape is
 * reported as skipped. Rules that never suspend keep the runtime's
 * cooperative guarantee: they run to completion and their verdict is
 * recorded normally.
