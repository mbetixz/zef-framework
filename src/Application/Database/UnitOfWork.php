/**
 * UoW-lite: a deferred-write queue with transactional flush semantics.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT a full Unit of Work — the framework has no ORM,
 * so there are no entities to track. What CQRS handlers actually need is a
 * place to COLLECT the writes a command produces (via {@see QueryBuilder}
 * or raw {@see SqlQuery}) and execute them ATOMICALLY as part of the
 * command's transaction, in FIFO order, exactly once:
 *
 * - handlers call {@see record()} / {@see recordQuery()} during dispatch
 *   (or anywhere in the scope);
 * - the {@see TransactionalCommandBus} flushes the
 *   queue on the transaction's connection BEFORE the commit — a flush
 *   failure rolls the whole command back;
 * - standalone callers flush themselves, inside their own transaction or
 *   in auto-commit mode (each operation then stands alone).
 *
 * Ordering & safety contract:
 * - operations run strictly FIFO on ONE connection, sequentially;
 * - the queue is cleared BEFORE execution starts: a failed operation is
 *   never retried from this queue (the surrounding transaction rollback
 *   is the failure story; a retried command re-records fresh operations);
 * - {@see flush()} re-entry is refused loudly — an operation that flushes
 *   mid-flush has ambiguous ordering and is a caller bug;
 * - recording DURING a flush is likewise refused for the same reason.

     * Unlike {@see flush()}, this method preserves the queued operations
     * across retry attempts — the snapshot is replayed each attempt
     * until either the flush succeeds or the policy is exhausted. The
     * queue is cleared ONLY on a successful flush; when a throwable
     * escapes this method (non-retryable, or the policy exhausted), the
     * queue is deliberately left populated. Each attempt uses its own
     * transaction or nested savepoint, and failed writes are rolled back
     * before retry. Callers must resolve a failed transaction or uncertain
     * commit outcome before considering a manual replay.
     *
     * Contract (see docs/TRANSACTION-HOOKS.md §"UoW retry strategy"):
     * - Only the FLUSH phase is retried — never the command handler
     *   body. Side effects produced during dispatch are NOT re-run.
     * - The policy decides retryability via
     *   {@see UnitOfWorkRetryPolicy::isRetryable()}; non-retryable
     *   throwables propagate immediately.
     * - On exhaustion the last operation throwable propagates after rollback.
     * - Begin, rollback and commit/savepoint-release failures propagate
     *   without retry. In particular, losing the entire transaction must
     *   never restart only the flush and silently discard handler writes.
     * - Callbacks must only perform transactional DB writes; they must not
     *   manage transaction boundaries or produce external side effects.
